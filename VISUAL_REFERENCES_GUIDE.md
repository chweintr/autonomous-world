# Visual References Guide

## 📁 Where to Put Your Images

I've created this structure for you:

```
visual_references/
├── characters/           ← Character appearance, clothing, gestures
├── locations/           ← Spaces, environments, architecture
├── atmosphere/          ← Light, color, weather, mood
└── reference_works/     ← Your finished paintings/key pieces
```

## 📝 How to Organize (Recommendations)

### File Naming

**Don't stress about names, but helpful patterns:**

```
characters/
├── rider_leopard_jacket_01.jpg
├── rider_with_horse_tense_02.jpg
├── horse_ears_back_fear.jpg
└── military_posture_study.jpg

locations/
├── courtyard_dusk_01.jpg
├── courtyard_shadows_harsh.jpg
└── broken_archway_detail.jpg

atmosphere/
├── dusk_pink_to_blue_sequence/
│   ├── 01_pink_sky.jpg
│   ├── 02_transition.jpg
│   └── 03_deep_blue.jpg
└── dust_in_light.jpg

reference_works/
├── painting_courtyard_series_01.jpg
├── painting_rider_and_horse_main.jpg
└── color_study_pinks_and_earth.jpg
```

**Or just:**
```
characters/
├── IMG_001.jpg
├── IMG_002.jpg
...

reference_works/
├── my_painting_1.jpg
├── my_painting_2.jpg
```

**System will analyze them regardless.**

### Image Formats

**Accepted:**
- `.jpg` / `.jpeg` (most common)
- `.png` (if you have them)
- `.tif` / `.tiff` (high quality scans)
- `.webp` (modern format)

**Resolution:**
- **Minimum**: 512x512 (for AI analysis)
- **Good**: 1024x1024 or larger
- **Best**: Original resolution of your work

**Don't resize unless huge** - system will handle it.

### How Many Images?

**Minimum to start:**
- 5-10 reference works (your paintings)
- 10-20 character/location studies
- Total: 15-30 images

**Good starting point:**
- 10-20 reference works
- 30-50 character/location/atmosphere
- Total: 40-70 images

**Comprehensive:**
- All relevant work you have
- 100+ images fine
- More = better understanding of your style

**Start small, add more as you go.**

## 🏷️ Optional: Create an Index

Create `visual_references/index.md` to tag key pieces:

```markdown
# Visual Reference Index

## Key Works (Reference Works)

### Primary Visual Language
- `reference_works/courtyard_series_01.jpg`
  - Best captures overall tone
  - Color palette to emphasize
  - Spatial arrangement is key

- `reference_works/rider_main.jpg`
  - Defines Marcus's appearance
  - Leopard print pattern here is canonical
  - Gesture and posture reference

## Characters

### The Rider
- **Canonical appearance**: `characters/rider_01.jpg`
- **Gesture studies**: `characters/rider_hands_*.jpg`
- **With Redline**: `characters/rider_horse_01.jpg`
- **Key colors**: Leopard print (this specific pattern), black, worn leather brown

### The Handler
- **Canonical appearance**: `characters/handler_vest.jpg`
- **With pigs**: `characters/handler_pigs_circle.jpg`
- **Key colors**: Earth tones, blue embroidery, pink pigs

## Locations

### Courtyard
- **Primary reference**: `locations/courtyard_main.jpg`
- **Light at dusk**: `locations/courtyard_dusk.jpg`
- **Important details**: Cracked concrete pattern, archway angle

## Atmosphere

### Dusk Light (Priority)
- `atmosphere/dusk_pink_to_blue_sequence/`
- This color transition is essential

### Material Textures
- Leopard print: `atmosphere/leopard_texture.jpg`
- Concrete: `atmosphere/cracked_concrete.jpg`
```

**Not required** - but helps me prioritize what matters most to you.

## 🎯 What Happens Next (Phase 2)

Once you've organized references:

### 1. Visual Analysis (Automated)

System will:
- Scan all images
- Extract color palettes
- Identify compositions
- Analyze spatial arrangements
- Tag visual elements
- Create visual database

### 2. Character/Location Linking

System will:
- Link images to characters (based on folders/tags)
- Build visual profiles
- Extract signature colors per character
- Understand location atmospheres

### 3. Style Encoding

System will:
- Analyze your reference works
- Extract your:
  - Color relationships
  - Compositional patterns
  - Light qualities
  - Gestural style
  - Material rendering
- Create "style signature"

### 4. Generation Integration

When generating images:
- Pull relevant references
- Use your color palettes
- Apply your compositional patterns
- Match your light qualities
- Stay true to your visual language

---

## 💡 Tips

### Quality Over Quantity
- 20 great images > 100 mediocre ones
- Focus on pieces that capture what you want
- Your best work defines the style

### Variety Within Consistency
- Show range within your aesthetic
- Different light conditions
- Various character poses
- Multiple locations views
- But all clearly "your" work

### Document Your Process
- Include sketches if relevant
- Color studies helpful
- Compositional thumbnails useful
- Anything showing your visual thinking

### Update Over Time
- Add new paintings as you make them
- Remove references that feel wrong
- Refine as your vision clarifies
- System adapts to changes

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Gather Images (This Week)

Collect:
- 5-10 of your best paintings from this world
- 10-20 studies/references for characters/locations
- Any atmospheric studies (light, color, texture)

Don't overthink it - get them in the folders.

### Step 2: Organize into Folders

```
visual_references/
├── characters/          ← Character-related
├── locations/          ← Space-related  
├── atmosphere/         ← Light/color/mood
└── reference_works/    ← Your finished paintings
```

### Step 3: Optional - Create Index

`visual_references/index.md` noting key pieces.

### Step 4: Let Me Know

When ready, I'll:
- Build the analysis pipeline
- Process your references
- Show you what it extracted
- Generate first test images
- Refine based on your feedback

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: My images are all different sizes/formats**
A: That's fine. System handles it.

**Q: Some are photos, some are scans of paintings**
A: Both work. Include what you have.

**Q: I have hundreds of images**
A: Great! Include them all. More data = better.

**Q: I only have a few finished pieces**
A: That's enough to start. 5-10 paintings can define a style.

**Q: Can I add more later?**
A: Yes. System re-analyzes when you add new references.

**Q: What if I change my mind about the visual direction?**
A: Remove old references, add new ones, system adapts.

**Q: Do I need to label/tag everything?**
A: No. Folder organization is enough. Tags are bonus.

**Q: What if I don't have images for every location?**
A: That's fine. We can generate from similar references.

**Q: Should I include work-in-progress?**
A: If it shows something useful, yes.

## 📋 Quick Checklist

Before Phase 2:

- [ ] Gather 15-30+ images (more is fine)
- [ ] Organize into four folders
- [ ] Include some finished paintings
- [ ] Include character/location references
- [ ] (Optional) Create index.md
- [ ] Let me know you're ready

---

**Once your references are organized, we can begin Phase 2 and your visual language becomes the system's visual language.**
