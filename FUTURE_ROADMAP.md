## Phase 2: Image Integration (3-6 Months)

### Phase 2a: Your Images Define the World

**What we build:**
System that understands YOUR visual language through your existing work.

**Process:**
1. You organize existing images/paintings
2. System analyzes them for:
   - Color palettes
   - Compositional patterns
   - Lighting qualities
   - Spatial arrangements
3. Creates visual profiles for each character/location
4. Field notes now reference your visual vocabulary

**Output:**
Enhanced text descriptions tied to your specific aesthetic.

**Tech:**
- Image analysis (CLIP, color extraction)
- Visual database
- No generation yet, just understanding

### Phase 2b: Generate Images from Field Notes

**What we build:**
Automated image generation that uses your visual language.

**Process:**
1. Field note generated (text)
2. System pulls relevant visual references from your work
3. Builds prompt using your colors, compositions
4. Generates image via:
   - Stable Diffusion (trained on your work), OR
   - DALL-E 3 / Midjourney (with your references), OR
   - Custom LoRA model (your style)
5. You curate/select

**Output:**
Images per field note, in your visual style.

**Your workflow:**
Text → Auto-generated image → Your selection/refinement → Painting

**Tech options:**
- **Easy**: API-based (Replicate, OpenAI)
- **Advanced**: Local Stable Diffusion + LoRA
- **Pro**: Fine-tuned model on your work

### Phase 2c: Iterative Visual Refinement

**What we build:**
Feedback loop where generated images improve over time.

**Process:**
1. System generates images
2. You select favorites
3. System learns from selections
4. Future generations weighted toward your choices
5. Your new paintings become references
6. Cycle continues

**Output:**
Self-improving visual generator aligned with your evolving aesthetic.

**Tech:**
- Preference learning
- Style adaptation
- Continuous training (optional)

## Phase 3: Video & AR (6-12 Months)

### Phase 3a: Image-to-Video

**What it enables:**
Static moments become moving sequences.

**Process:**
1. Field note describes interaction over time
2. System generates key frames (images)
3. Interpolates between frames using:
   - Runway Gen-2/Gen-3
   - Pika Labs
   - Stability AI video models
   - Future: Google Veo, OpenAI Sora
4. Creates short clips (2-10 seconds)

**Example:**
```
Field Note: "Marcus grips reins. Horse ears flatten. Pig circles."
  ↓
Key Frames: [Initial pose] [Tension] [Horse reaction] [Pig movement]
  ↓
Video: 5-second clip showing the progression
```

**Output:**
Video sequences of character interactions in your visual style.

**Your workflow:**
Scenario → Images → Video clips → Curate → Use as painting studies/animation

**Tech:**
- Image-to-video models (RunwayML, Pika)
- Temporal consistency
- Style preservation across frames

### Phase 3b: AR Placement

**What it enables:**
Place characters in real spaces via phone/tablet AR.

**Process:**
1. Run simulation
2. Characters have spatial coordinates
3. AR app (8th Wall, ARCore, ARKit)
4. Point camera at space
5. See characters/animals in that space
6. Walk around them
7. Capture views for painting reference

**Example:**
- Point phone at your studio floor
- See Marcus and Redline in courtyard arrangement
- Walk around, find best angle
- Screenshot for painting

**Output:**
Spatial observation of scenes before painting them.

**Tech:**
- AR frameworks (8th Wall, Niantic Lightship)
- Spatial mapping
- 3D character representations (from your images)

### Phase 3c: Spatial Composition Tool

**What it enables:**
Arrange characters in virtual space, view from any angle.

**Process:**
1. Select field note
2. Open spatial viewer
3. Characters placed in 3D space
4. Rotate camera, adjust lighting
5. Find composition you want
6. Generate image from that view
7. Paint it

**Output:**
Complete control over viewpoint and composition.

**Tech:**
- Web-based 3D viewer (Three.js)
- 2D images → 3D proxy models
- Lighting simulation
- Export rendered views

## Phase 4: Real-time Spatial (12-24 Months)

### Phase 4a: Niantic 8th Wall / Google Genie Integration

**What it enables:**
Characters exist in persistent 3D world you can explore.

**The Vision:**
Google Genie and similar tools (expected 2025-2026) will let you:
- Generate 3D worlds from images
- Navigate them in real-time
- Place autonomous agents inside
- Render from any viewpoint

**How we integrate:**
1. Your images → Genie world generation
2. Our character system → Autonomous agents in that world
3. You explore via VR/AR/screen
4. Characters make decisions, interact
5. You observe like a documentary filmmaker
6. Capture moments for painting

**Process:**
```
Your courtyard painting
  ↓
Genie generates navigable 3D courtyard
  ↓
Marcus & Redline placed inside
  ↓
They interact autonomously
  ↓
You fly camera around, observe
  ↓
Find moment, capture, paint
```

**Output:**
Explorable world where your characters live.

**Tech (anticipated):**
- Google Genie (or similar - Luma AI, etc.)
- 3D scene generation from images
- Real-time rendering
- Autonomous agent control

### Phase 4b: Real-time Character Animation

**What it enables:**
Characters move naturally, not just pose-to-pose.

**Tech (emerging):**
- Motion generation AI (move.ai, Plask)
- Character animation from text
- Gesture synthesis
- Facial animation (if needed)

**Process:**
1. Decision engine: "Marcus grips reins tightly"
2. Motion AI generates hand animation
3. Emotional state affects gesture quality
4. Plays in real-time 3D space
5. You observe from any angle

**Output:**
Living, moving characters in explorable space.

### Phase 4c: Dynamic Lighting & Atmosphere

**What it enables:**
Time of day, weather affect the visual in real-time.

**Features:**
- Dusk light changes pink to blue in real-time
- Dust particles in air
- Shadows move with sun position
- Fire flickers
- Weather transitions

**Based on:**
- Your atmospheric paintings
- Simulation time-of-day system
- Real-time rendering engines

   - Navigate 3D space naturally
   - Interact with environment and each other
   - Express psychology through movement

2. **You observe and document**
   - Enter world via VR/AR/screen
   - Move freely through space
   - No control over characters (pure observation)
   - Capture moments from any angle
   - Multiple viewing sessions create different experiences

3. **World evolves**
   - Time passes continuously
   - Weather changes
   - Locations wear and age
   - Characters' relationships deepen
   - History accumulates

4. **Emergence at scale**
   - Patterns develop over weeks/months
   - Rituals form organically
   - Territories establish
   - Mythology emerges
   - You discover it, don't script it

### Your Creative Process (Phase 5)

```
1. "Check in" on the world
2. Observe what's happening
3. Follow characters of interest
4. Find charged moments
5. Capture from your chosen viewpoint
6. World continues after you leave
7. Next visit: Something new has happened
8. Infinite source material
```
