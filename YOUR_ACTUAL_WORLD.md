# Your Actual World - What I See in the Images

## 🎨 The Paintings (Sculptural Impasto Works)

**What they are:**
- Thick impasto oil paintings
- Epoxy clay/sculptural elements
- Relief quality (dimensional)
- Figures + animals + objects
- Pink/aqua/yellow/green/white palette
- Textured, built-up surfaces

**What they show:**
- Characters FROM the world
- Like production stills or character studies
- Visual reference for the cinematic world

---

## 🎬 The World Itself (Cinematic/Editorial)

**NOT made of paint** - the world is:
- Cinematic (like Delicatessen film)
- Fashion editorial-esque (like Thom Browne campaign)
- Photographic/filmic quality
- Characters from paintings now "photographed" or "filmed"

**Think:**
- Your paintings = character design/visual development
- The simulation = fashion editorial shoot in that world
- Or: Behind-the-scenes of a Jeunet film with your characters

---

## 👥 Characters (From What I See)

### Formal Bikers
- **Navy suits with gold epaulets** (military braid, tailored)
- **Pink polos with striped sleeves** (Thom Browne precision)
- **Elaborate embroidery** (nonsensical patterns, formal application)
- **Groomed beards** - some real, some prosthetic (can't tell which)
- **Round glasses, styled hair**
- **Sharp, deliberate grooming**

### The Aesthetic:
- Formal tailoring applied absurdly
- Military details without military function
- Everything groomed, nothing casual
- Beards as costume element
- Thom Browne meets biker meets formal portrait

---

## 🏍️ Motorcycles ⇄ Horses

**The Fluidity:**
- Sometimes it's clearly a motorcycle
- Sometimes it's clearly a horse  
- Sometimes it's both
- Sometimes it's ambiguous
- Characters treat them identically
- "Motorcycle-shaped steed" / "Horse with chrome"

**In descriptions:**
- Don't explain which it is
- Let it be uncertain
- "The motorcycle. Or the horse."
- Treated as normal

---

## 🐷 Animals (Sculptural Companions)

**From your paintings:**
- **Pink pigs** - chunky, textured, present
- **White animals** - sculptural, dimensional
- **Companions at scale** - dog-sized pigs, etc.
- **Painted/sculpted quality** in the paintings

**In the cinematic world:**
- Same animals but "real" (editorial/film quality)
- Still externalize emotions
- Still present and dimensional
- Pink pigs, white creatures
- Treated as normal companions

---

## 🎨 Color Palette (CORRECTED)

### Dominant Colors (From Your Work):

**Pinks:**
- Bubble gum pink
- Salmon
- Hot pink
- Dusty rose
- Pink grounds everywhere

**Aqua/Turquoise:**
- Swimming pool aqua
- Mint
- Teal
- Turquoise backgrounds (very Thom Browne)

**Yellows:**
- Butter yellow
- Gold (metallic)
- Mustard
- Bright yellow

**Greens:**
- Sage green
- Bright green (cacti)
- Olive
- Dark green

**Whites:**
- Cream
- Stark white
- Ivory
- White animals

**Blacks/Navy:**
- Deep black (contrast)
- Navy suits
- Dark patterned elements

### NOT:
- ❌ Desert ochres
- ❌ Dusty browns  
- ❌ Sunset oranges (except occasional)
- ❌ Earth tones

---

## 🏗️ Spaces (From Your Paintings)

**Interiors:**
- Aqua/turquoise walls (very common in Browne refs)
- Pink floors (checkered, textured)
- Patterned surfaces
- Neon signs, architectural elements
- Formal but strange
- Like fashion shoot locations or film sets

**Exteriors:**
- Pink textured grounds
- Cacti (green, sculptural)
- Sky as color field (aqua, pink, dramatic)
- NOT realistic landscape
- More like editorial location or stage set

**Quality:**
- Clean but strange
- Formal but absurd
- Designed spaces
- Everything deliberate

---

## ✍️ Writing Style (CORRECTED)

### What You Want:

**Nabokov:**
- Precise, specific
- Absurd as fact
- Syntactic play
- Pattern obsession
- Cool observation

**Chabon:**
- Accessible
- Warm but not sentimental
- Literary but readable
- Detail-rich

**Lean, Not Overwrought:**
- Short sentences good
- ONE detail, not three adjectives
- "The beard is styled" not "the carefully groomed, impeccably styled beard"
- Direct over purple

**WITH DIALOGUE:**
- Characters speak to each other
- Quotation marks
- Sparse but present
- Reveals character through what they say

---

## 🎯 Updated Direction

### For Field Notes to Describe:

**A cinematic/editorial world where:**
- Bikers wear embroidered suits (elaborate, nonsensical)
- Motorcycles are horses, horses are motorcycles (fluid, ambiguous)
- Everyone formally groomed (beards real or prosthetic, unclear)
- Sharp old women, tailored figures
- Animals (pink pigs, white creatures) externalize emotions
- Pink and aqua dominate
- Strange is normal
- Like a Thom Browne editorial shot in a Jeunet film
- With your painted characters as the cast

### Writing Should Sound Like:

> "The figure in navy sits on the motorcycle-horse. The beard is real. Or prosthetic. Hard to say in this light. The pig circles twice. 'You're late,' someone says. The aqua wall reflects nothing."

**Not:**
> "The tall, weathered biker with the carefully groomed silver beard sat astride his gleaming motorcycle, his scarred hands gripping the worn leather..."

## 🔄 Changes Just Made:

1. ✅ **System prompt**: Nabokov/Chabon, lean prose, Delicatessen meets editorial
2. ✅ **Prompt**: Explicitly asks for dialogue, shorter sentences, your palette
3. ✅ **Decision engine**: Characters now 70% likely to interact with each other (not just observe)
4. ✅ **World description**: Cinematic not painterly, motorcycle-horses, beards, embroidery

## 🚀 **Test It Now:**

1. Terminal: `Ctrl+C` then `python3 run.py`
2. Browser: Refresh, seed scenario, run again
3. Should get: **Dialogue, leaner prose, actual interactions, your aesthetic**
