  "physical_description": "Old woman, white hair cropped short. Wears vintage cheerleader uniform—pleated skirt in faded coral and mint, matching vest with school letters peeling off. Knee-high white boots, scuffed but polished. Pom-poms attached to belt, never used. Face lined but animated. Moves with unexpected energy.",
  "backstory": "Arrived wearing the uniform. Won't say which school, which team, which year. When asked, responds: 'The important game hasn't happened yet.' Attends events that don't exist. Cheers for outcomes already decided. The uniform shows decades of wear but is maintained obsessively—each stitch repaired, each letter re-glued.",
