# Aesthetic Reference Notes

**Important**: The images in `visual_references/Aesthetic:Visual Language/` are **art references**, not literal world depiction. The actual simulation world is a **more cinematic, toned-down version** of this aesthetic.

## Art vs World

**Art References (highly stylized)**:
- Extremely saturated pastels
- Surreal staging (outdoor furniture, pink flamingos, etc.)
- High fashion editorial quality
- Theatrical lighting

**Simulation World (cinematic version)**:
- Same color palette but slightly more naturalistic
- Same costume/character sensibility but lived-in
- Same wetness/reflections but from rain/environment, not staging
- Dreamlike but plausible

## Key Visual Elements from References

### Character Types & Clothing

**Bearded Figures**:
- Elaborate prosthetic or real beards - meticulously groomed
- Often with mustaches, sometimes dyed (orange/red visible in refs)
- Paired with military-style caps, helmets, headwraps

**Clothing Patterns**:
- Floral embroidery dense on jackets (yellow jacket with florals + animals)
- Satin/silk fabrics catching light (coral, salmon, mustard yellow)
- Military-influenced: epaulettes with fringe, medals, badges
- Kimono-like patterned robes mixed with Western tailoring
- Track suits mixed with formal wear
- Color blocking: mint boots with coral pants with yellow jacket

**Accessories**:
- Oversized sunglasses (futuristic visors, vintage frames)
- Military caps with emblems
- Multiple badges/patches on uniforms
- Animals as accessories (exotic cats, parrots)

### Environment Details

**Wet Surfaces EVERYWHERE**:
- Puddles reflecting buildings, sky, neon
- Recently mopped floors
- Rain-slicked pavement
- Creates double-images, reflections

**Architecture**:
- Pastel stucco: coral pink, mint green, turquoise
- Art deco/mid-century modern motifs
- Neon signs (cursive script, geometric shapes)
- Roadside motel aesthetic
- Color-blocked buildings (turquoise + coral + cream)

**Surreal Props** (toned down for cinematic world):
- Pink flamingo lawn ornaments → sparse decorative elements
- Striped outdoor furniture → vintage furnishings
- Dramatic cloudy skies → atmospheric weather
- Flowering plants (pink blooms, tropical vegetation)

**Ground Textures**:
- Wet asphalt/concrete
- Grass patches
- Terrazzo visible indoors
- Everything shows wear and use

### Color Palette (from refs)

**Primaries**:
- Coral/salmon pink
- Mint/turquoise green
- Mustard/sulfur yellow
- Rust orange
- Cream/bone white

**Accents**:
- Chrome/silver (reflective)
- Gold (embroidery, badges)
- Deep teal/navy (sky, shadows)
- Pink (flowering plants, neon)

**Metallics**:
- Gold thread in embroidery
- Chrome motorcycle parts
- Brass fixtures
- Silver accessories

### Animals Integrated

**From References**:
- Exotic cats on shoulders
- Birds (parrots visible)
- Pink flamingos (lawn ornaments)
- Dogs implied

**For Simulation**:
- Pigs, dogs, birds, horses
- Animals mirror human emotional states
- Integrated naturally, not symbolic
- Specific physical details

## Image Generation Prompt Format

**Good example** (from user):
> "lanky male with prosthetic beard and sequined jacket stand in front of a neon sign that appears to show a catfish. he is sipping something dark in a cocktail glass while an exotic cat sits on his shoulder. there is a woman tugging at his sleeve. unclear if he notices her. she is almost as tall as he is and has dark skin and is holding a plant or a palm frond or similar"

**Key elements**:
- Physical character descriptions (height, skin tone, clothing specifics)
- Spatial relationships (on shoulder, tugging sleeve, in front of)
- Actions described visually (sipping, holding, unclear if notices)
- Props and environment (neon sign, cocktail glass, plant)
- NO DIALOGUE IN QUOTES

**Bad for image gen**:
> "How many days?" Witness asks. "Tomorrow." The One Who Knows nods.

This gets converted to:
> Witness gestures questioningly toward The One Who Knows. The One Who Knows pauses, slight tilt of head, considering posture.

## Cinematic Translation

**Art reference**: Figure in yellow floral jacket standing in puddle with surreal striped couch outdoors

**Cinematic world**: Figure in yellow embroidered jacket stands in wet street after rain, passing by furniture left curbside for collection, neon sign reflects in puddle

**Art reference**: Military uniforms with coral color, futuristic visors, pink flowering plants background

**Cinematic world**: Two figures in military-inspired jackets with coral accents and badges, standing near vegetation, one wearing vintage sunglasses, atmospheric haze

**Keep**:
- Color palette
- Clothing sensibility
- Wetness/reflections
- Character types
- Pattern mixing
- Prosthetics/accessories
- **Embroidery/decoration on vehicles** (motorcycles, saddles)

**Tone down**:
- Staging surrealism
- Saturation levels
- Editorial theatricality

**Make plausible**:
- Props have reasons (not just staged)
- Weather causes wetness
- Locations feel lived-in
- Actions have context

## Key Detail: Vehicles as Art Objects

From reference image - motorcycle tank has PAINTED/EMBROIDERED floral patterns. This is crucial:
- Vehicles decorated like clothing
- Embroidery/paint on motorcycle tanks, fairings, saddles
- Chrome parts left reflective, painted parts get patterns
- Personalization: florals, geometric designs, animal motifs
- Leather saddles tooled with patterns
- Not factory—customized, hand-done

Example: "Motorcycle tank painted with coral florals overlapping mint leaves, chrome exhaust reflecting twilight, leather seat tooled with spiral pattern"

## Interior Spaces - Found Object Assemblage Aesthetic

**NEW references added Nov 9** show INTERIOR SPACES with completely different energy:

### Bathrooms as Primary Interior Setting
- **Mint/turquoise tile walls** (small square tiles - same color as clothing but as architecture)
- Vintage fixtures: clawfoot bathtubs, pedestal sinks, toilets, exposed plumbing
- **Every surface COVERED** - maximalist assemblage, no negative space
- Water as element: bathtubs filled, puddles on floor, reflections everywhere
- Tropical plants dense: palms in corners, trailing vines, cacti
- Mirrors and frames layered on walls
- Rotary phones, clocks, vintage objects mounted/displayed

### Animals Inhabiting Infrastructure
**Critical distinction**: Animals don't just ACCOMPANY humans - they INHABIT the spaces:
- **Albino alligators swimming in bathtubs** (bathtub as aquarium)
- **Cats sitting inside stove compartments** (stove as den)
- **Flamingos perched on driftwood** mounted above fixtures
- Birds on toilet tanks, sink edges
- Infrastructure repurposed as animal habitat

### Kitchen/Stove Imagery
- **Ornate cast iron stoves** (black with gold baroque decoration)
- Gothic elements: skulls visible, bats, dark romantic aesthetic
- **Neon hearts** mounted above stoves (pink neon in domestic space)
- Stoves as vertical sculptures - viewed from above/aerial
- Flames visible at bottom (orange/warm glow)
- Animals nested in compartments

### Maximalist Density
**Complete opposite of minimalism**:
- Horror vacui (fear of empty space) - every inch decorated
- Objects layered: trinkets, found objects, assemblage art
- Floor covered in arrangements of small objects
- Walls dense with frames, mirrors, mounted curiosities
- Cabinet of curiosities aesthetic
- Nothing functional - everything sculptural/inhabited

### Color Palette (Same but Different Context)
- **Mint/turquoise** = tile walls, water color
- **Coral/pink** = flamingos, neon hearts, decorative elements
- **Rust/orange** = stove ornamentation, flames
- **Gothic dark** = black stoves, shadows, baroque elements
- **Gold/brass** = ornate stove decoration, fixtures, frames

### Lighting in Interiors
- Neon signs INSIDE rooms (not just exterior)
- Vintage bulbs, ornate fixtures
- Water reflections creating moving light
- Darker overall than outdoor scenes
- Gothic atmospheric lighting mixed with neon glow

### Domestic Fixtures as Found Art
- Stoves, tubs, sinks, toilets = sculptural objects
- Not hidden or utilitarian - celebrated as art
- Plumbing exposed and decorative
- Vintage appliances repurposed
- Everything encrusted with decoration

### For Cinematic World Translation

**Art references show**: Surreal maximalist interior with alligators in bathtub, every surface covered, pink flamingos

**Cinematic world version**: Interior bathroom with mint tile walls showing age. Clawfoot tub holds water, unclear if functional. Animal (alligator? large reptile?) resting in tub. Walls layered with vintage objects - rotary phone mounted, small mirror reflecting neon from adjacent room. Tropical plant in corner. Floor damp, objects arranged deliberately.

**Keep**:
- Mint tile color
- Vintage fixtures
- Animals in unexpected places
- Dense object layering
- Neon in interiors

**Tone down**:
- Surreal density (make slightly sparser)
- Perfect maintenance (show wear)
- Impossible animal combinations

**Make plausible**:
- Why is bathtub filled? (Broken plumbing? Intentional?)
- Why animal there? (Lives there? Trapped? Chose it?)
- Objects have history (not just arranged - accumulated)
