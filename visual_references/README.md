# Visual References Directory

This is where you'll place your images to define the visual language of the world (Phase 2).

## 📁 Directory Structure

```
visual_references/
├── characters/          Your images showing character appearance, clothing, gestures
├── locations/          Your images showing spaces, environments, architecture
├── atmosphere/         Your images showing light, color, weather, mood
└── reference_works/    Your finished paintings and key pieces
```

## 🎨 Phase 1 (Current): Not Used Yet

The visual reference system isn't active yet. You can:
- Leave these folders empty, OR
- Start organizing your images now for Phase 2

## 🔮 Phase 2 (Future): Visual Integration

When you're ready to add image generation:

1. **Organize your existing images** into these folders
2. **System analyzes them** for color, composition, style
3. **Generated images** use your visual language
4. **Output matches** your aesthetic, not generic AI art

## 📖 What to Put Here

### characters/
- Character appearance references
- Clothing patterns (leopard print, stripes, embroidery)
- Postures and gestures
- Animal studies (horses, pigs, wolves, birds)
- Color palettes for each character

### locations/
- Spatial references
- Desert, courtyard, architectural fragments
- Lighting in different spaces
- Textures (concrete, adobe, wood)
- Your paintings of these environments

### atmosphere/

- Color relationships
- Weather effects (dust, wind, heat)
- Material textures
- Mood references

### reference_works/
- Your best finished paintings from this world
- Color studies
- Compositional sketches
- Anything showing your visual thinking

## 📏 Guidelines

**Image formats:** jpg, png, tif, webp  
**Resolution:** 1024x1024+ recommended (512x512 minimum)  
**Quantity:** Start with 15-30 images, add more over time

## ⏱️ When to Do This

**Not urgent** - Phase 1 works without any images.

**Then let me know** and I'll build the integration.
